# Object Detection Assistant for the visually impaired individuals

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and supporting code to build an Object Detection Assistant. The application is designed to help visually impaired users understand the contents of images by detecting objects, summarizing the results, and converting the summary into speech that will communicate the results with visually impaired people

## Project Structure

- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the application.
- `Object_detection_assistant.ipynb`: The code of the AI assistant.

## Hugging Face Models 

`detr-resnet-50` : well-regarded choice for object detection tasks. It's part of a wide range of models available in the AI ecosystem, accessible through platforms like the Hugging Face Hub.


`vits-ljs`: text-to-speech pipeline from kakao-enterprise.


## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
