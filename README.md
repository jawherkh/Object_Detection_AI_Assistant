# Object Detection Assistant for the visually impaired individuals

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and supporting code to build an Object Detection Assistant. The application is designed to help visually impaired users understand the contents of images by detecting objects, summarizing the results, and converting the summary into speech that will communicate the results with visually impaired people

## Project Structure

- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the application.
- `src/`: Source code and utilities.
  - `object_detection_assistant.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the object detection and text-to-speech code.
  - `text_to_speech.py`: Python script to handle text-to-speech conversion.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions used in the project.
- `data/`: Directory to store images or other data files.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
